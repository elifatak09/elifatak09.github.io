<p> The Wawel Hill is the most important monument of Polish history, culture and national identity.
  
  The beginnings of the residence of Polish rulers on the Wawel Hill go back to the middle of the 11th century. In the 14th century the castle was expanded into a vast Gothic residence. The castle was then rebuilt in a Renaissance style at the beginning of the 16th century.</p>
  
 <p> The Wawel Cathedral, located at the Castle served as coronation site of the Polish kings as well as their burial place. One of its chapels, the Sigismund Chapel roofed with a golden dome, is one of the most eminent examples of the Rennaissance style in Krakow.</p>
  
<p>After moving the capital to Warsaw in the 17th century, Polish monarchs rarely visited the castle, and after Poland lots its independence in 1796 the castle was overtaken by the Austrian army which contributed greatly to the deterioration of the castle. After Poland regained its independence the Wawel Castle was announced to be the representative building of the Polish state and the it became a national museum.</p>

<p>The Wawel Cathedral, Katedra Wawelska in Polish, was the coronation site of Polish monarchs and remains Poland's most important national sanctuary. Thanks to its 1000-year-old history and numerous treasures the Krakow cathedral is arguably the most interesting place in the whole country, with the adjacent Wawel Royal Castle being the close second. Its present 14th-century walls shelter a great variety of top-class objects of art, from Gothic to Renaissance to Baroque to Classicist to Modern. It is also the burial ground of most Polish royalty as well as the greatest national heroes, two poets, four saints and countless Krakow bishops. </p>

<p>This is the place of the most “mosts”: the most important public space in Kraków, the most expansive Market Square of medieval Europe, it gathers everything most characteristic of the city and has its most distinctive hallmarks, and last but not least: the most beautiful, the most important, the most charming, the most…</p>

<p>The huge main square was staked out for the city when Kraków received its city charter based on Magdeburg Law in 1257. It was set up at the intersection of ancient trading routes, on the plan of a square, with each side slightly exceeding 200 m (650 ft). The name Rynek (Market Square), deriving from the German word Ring, was first used around 1300, and the current one – Rynek Główny (Main Market Square)– has only been in use since the end of the 19th century.</p>

<p>The urban design followed the distinctive cross grid layout, characteristic of mediaeval cities, with the Market Square becoming its central point. There are three streets leaving each side of the market, with only Grodzka, running along an ancient trading route and in the close vicinity of St Adalbert’s Church, receiving a different form: that of a broadway running at an angle. Some other concessions and derogations also had to be made, as there had been earlier structures standing in the area even before the charter; they obviously included St Mary’s and St Adalbert’s church. With its regular urban design retained since the Middle Ages and the central Main Market Square, Kraków’s city centre was inscribed on the original UNESCO list in 1978, which made it one of the world’s first twelve UNESCO-listed sites.</p>

<p>Full of majestic architectural monuments, priceless cultural treasures, cobbled thoroughfares, atmospheric courtyards, legendary cellar bars and literary cafes, Kraków's historic Old Town is the pride of Poland, one of Central Europe's most beautiful architectural showpieces, and one of the world's most popular tourist destinations. The most important Polish city to not come out of World War II looking like a trampled Lego set, the rich cultural and historical value of Poland's former royal capital earned it well-deserved inclusion on the first-ever UNESCO World Heritage List in 1978.</p>

<p>Already a busy medieval commercial centre by the 10th century, the nucleus of Kraków's Old Town is Rynek Główny - the largest medieval market square in Central Europe. Characterised by its unique upside-down teardrop shape - dictated by the city's former medieval defensive walls extending from Wawel Castle to the south - today the Old Town is surrounded by the charming belt of public green space known as the 'Planty.' Standing in place of the city's medieval moat, the Planty draws a clear line around the original medieval centre of Kraków, however most modern definitions of Kraków's 'Old Town' extend to the 'aleja' - that is, the two-lane motorway encircling the town. For our purposes, we have given a slightly wider scope to the Old Town so that it can basically include any venue within reasonable walking district of the market square (including some of the far side of the aleja), thus avoiding the creation of superfluous 'districts' within the centre of Kraków.</p>
